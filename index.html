At PHS, tech won't be used to make instruction more efficient per se, it will be used to make construction more deep, divergent, and creative.

                    <p>Staff will onboard for a year before they start working full time with YP. During that time, they'll be building relationships with YP and families via outreach. In addition to having general outreach available to all (~650?) MS students in Somerville, we'll have targetted outreach to folks struggling in t.a.s, a group of people which cuts across ses, race, SPED, ELL status.</p>

                    <p>PHS staff's responsbilities won't look like that of traditional teachers in classrooms separated by discipline. Instead staff will be working in teams, advisories, with a cohort of YP for 4 years, running immersive, interdiscplinary programs, helping with individual projects, connecting YP and families with resources, and doing creative work of their own… this means that our structure, hiring, and evaluation process look a bit different from that of traditional academic contexts.</p>

                    <p>Staff's goal setting and evaluation process will rhyme with that of YP at PHS. At PHS staff are not transmitters of information but rather mentors, and project-doers themselves. This means that their evaluation process doesn't look that different from what YP go through.</p>
